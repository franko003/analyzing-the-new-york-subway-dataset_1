    As you can see, there are numerous data points included in each row of the
    a MTA Subway turnstile text file. 

    You want to write a function that will update each row in the text
    file so there is only one entry per row. A few examples below:
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,00:00:00,REGULAR,003178521,001100739

    Write the updates to a different text file in the format of "updated_" + filename.
    For example:
        1) if you read in a text file called "turnstile_110521.txt"
        2) you should write the updated data to "updated_turnstile_110521.txt"

    The order of the fields should be preserved. Remember to read through the
